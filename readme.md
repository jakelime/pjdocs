# PJdocs

Using sphinx-doc (python), run it on Java project to generate high
quality documentations


## Quickstart

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/jakelime/pjdocs-project.git


```


## Notes

Sphinx is a well-documented high quality project `pip install Sphinx`

To support Java projects, we can use [javasphinx](https://bronto-javasphinx.readthedocs.io/)

Howerver, the official `javasphinx` is already deprecated. We can use [lucag/javasphinx](https://github.com/lucag/javasphinx) to get
his compatibilty fixes to the latest `Sphinx` version
